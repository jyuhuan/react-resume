# React Resume

> ðŸš§ __Active Development in Progress__

A resume made out of React. See a live demo at [#](#).

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jyuhuan/react-resume my-resume
cd my-resume
npm install
webpack
```

Then execute the `generate.py` script. Copy the static files in the `static/` directory to your website.

## RoadMap

- [ ] Abstract over section types (i.e., design a unified representation of education, projects, experience, and potentially other types of sections)
- [ ] Make the resume visually editable in browser.
